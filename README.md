## Welcome to "the Program"! ##

I created this tiny project for 'GeekBrains' online school as a milestone project to prove my current skills. 

The program has two methods: the basic one gets an array of string values as input and returns the new array, which consists of first array's elements whose length is less than or equal to three characters. The second method is additional: it allows to fill in an array of string values manually.

GitHub link is: *https://github.com/Selge/GB_SpecProj*

The project has two versions:
- Python version (also added test file)
- C# version

Also you may check:
-  the 'readme' file and 
-  block diagram of the algorithm

it's added to the repository as well.
