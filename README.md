# Welcome to "the Program"! #

I created this tiny project for 'GeekBrains' online school as a milestone project to prove my current skills. 

## Decision explanation: ##

The program has two methods: the basic one gets an array of string values as input and returns the new array, which consists of first array's elements whose length is less than or equal to three characters. The second method is additional: it allows to fill in an array of string values manually.

The basic method ("Triple" in C# project or "three_or_less" in Python version) gets an array of string values as input and creates a new empty array for collecting target values. Then the program checks (one by one) each element's length in received array. If element's length is less or equal to 3 chars, computer will add it to the new array. As the result program returns a new array, composed from the items selected according to the given parameters.
